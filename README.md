# Microfashion-Trend-Analysis

## Introduction 

This project aims to analyze the demographics and sentiment of users on the streetwear subreddit to gain insights into microfashion trends. By extracting and analyzing Reddit comments, we can better understand the age, location, and sentiment of users discussing streetwear. This information can be valuable for Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) brands looking to tailor their marketing strategies and collaborations.

## Importing Libraries and Setting Up Reddit API
We Used praw to authenticate and access the Reddit API for scraping comments from the 'streetwear' subreddit and Pnadas for storing and manipulating the scraped comments in a DataFrame

## Database Creation through MySQL 
A new database was created. This is where all the data extracted from Reddit comments would be stored.
Connection: In the Python script, a connection was established between the Python application and the MySQL database. This connection allows the Python script to communicate with the database, execute queries, and retrieve data.

#### Table Creation
Within the MySQL database, a table was created to structure the Reddit comments data. The table schema defines the structure of the data, including the column names and data types.

#### Data Insertion 
After creating the table, the Reddit comments data was inserted into the MySQL database. This involved iterating over the extracted comments and inserting them into the appropriate columns in the database table.

#### Commit and Close
Once all the data was inserted, the changes were committed to the database. This ensures that the changes are saved permanently. Finally, the connection to the MySQL database was closed to free up system resources.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
**Regular expressions (re)** were utilized to extract age and location information from the comments. This step ensured that we had clean and structured data to work with. The cleaned data was saved back into an Excel file for subsequent analysis.

## Data Analysis
The cleaned data was analyzed using **pandas** . We calculated summary statistics for the age demographics, such as mean, median, and mode. We also determined the frequency distribution of age groups and identified the most common locations mentioned in the comments.

The graph shows the following:

The mean age is 42.5 years old.
The median age is 42.5 years old.
The mode age is 25 years old.
This suggests that the most common age among users commenting on the subreddit is 25, but the average user is older. There is a wider range of users between 25 and 50 than there are younger or older users.

## Data Visualization
Data visualization was performed using **matplotlib** and **seaborn**. We created histograms and bar charts to illustrate the age distribution and the most common locations of the commenters. These visualizations provided a clear and immediate understanding of the demographic breakdown.
